module.exports write API for app.js

The export statement is used when creating JavaScript modules to export functions, objects, or primitive values from the module so they can be used by other programs with the import statement.

Exported modules are in strict mode whether you declare them as such or not. The export statement cannot be used in embedded scripts.

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument,
which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
function greeting(name) {

}

function processUserInput(callback) {
  var name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
  callback(name);
}
processUserInput(greeting);
