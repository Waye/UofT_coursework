=============================
Basic features of our website
=============================

Our website will allow the seller of essential goods such as food, drink and clothings to sell their cancelled or refunded orders at a cheaper cost to non-profit organizations. Seller users will be able to post what they want to sell and see the request from the buyers. Buyer users will be able to make purchase on products that they are interested in and make requests to sellers. An message system is also implemented in our website for communication. 

Additionally, since our target buyer users are poor(might not have a laptop), we specifically work on responsive features on which will make them access our website easier on thier phone. Such as having anchors on the feedpage.

==========
index.html
==========

There are 3 buttons available in our index page, "Log in", "Sign up" and "Join Us".
By clicking "Sign up" and "Join us", you will be transferred to "signup.html" and be prompted to create an account of your own.
For now, since phase 1 does not allow us to connect with server. This is still a mock page.

By clicking "Log in", you will be transferred to "login.html" and can log in to 3 different pages by the credentials we provide:
- By entering "user" as username and password, user will be logged in into the buyer page.
- By entering "user2" as username and password, user will be logged in into the seller page.
- By entering "admin" as username and password, user will be logged in into the admin page.
The functionality of all three pages will be explained later.
By clicking "Forgot password?" button on the bottom of log in page, a mock data(for now), will be displayed on the top on the page under the header, 
saying an information has been sent to the email of the user.

===================
signup.html
===================
User will be able to register in this page. There are several restriction on registration.
1. username: length >= 5 chars
2. email: length >= 5 chars
3. phone: length >= 10 chars. must be all digits
4. password: length >= 5chars and repeat password should match
5. register as: must be selected from the dropdown.
If above condition is not met, error message will be shown for 4 seconds, indicating the first violating condition. 
Upon successful registration, registered information is also shown for 4 seconds by popup.

===================
feedpage_buyer.html
===================

Users need to be buyer to be logged in into this page, same for all the pages below which contains "buyer".
By sucessfully logging in as "buyer", user will then be transfered to "feedpage_buyer.html". All the product posts will be offer from sellers
 if user is logged in as buyer.

On the left side of the page you can notice there is a filter which helps you to filter all products that have been posted on our website.
By clicking any categories under the filter, the page will then show all the products of those categories clicked. Note, user can click multiple 
categories at the same time. For example, user can click both "food" and "electronics", which the page will then show all the food
 and electronics products.

You can also click "clear filters" once you have clicked some fiters which will then refresh the page. This can also be achieved by clicking
 the refresh icon besides "Filter".

Under the filter, there is "Min. price" and "Max. price" function which are promting users to enter the minimum and maximum price of products that 
they wish to look for. If users enter non-numeric input, then nothing will be updated.

On the right side of the "feed" bar where it contains the refresh bottom, it also contains a bottom called "Sort". By clicking it you will see
 a dropdown menu which shows multiple options of sorting the products. Such as, "Newest first", "Oldest first", "Highest price first", "Lowest
 price first".

### Navigation Bar ###
Navigation Bar is displayed on every page.
On the very left of the header, you can see there is a search bar which we have not yet implemented it fully as it requires back end. However, 
if you try to enter anything there, it will show the Nestea posted by User2 as an example of how it will look as the project goes on. 
By clicking the hand shaking icon on the left of search section, user will be able to return to the feedpage.

On the right side of the header there are four other buttons available, "Post a new request", "Profile", "Messages", and "Log Out". By clicking
 "Post a new request", a pop up form will be shown and allow users to upload images and enter price and category, etc to make a buyer request,
 which is basically creating a new post of request that is visible from sellers feedpage. For phase 1, this cannot shown since it requires 
 server call. Instead, the newly created post object is shown in console after clicking "submit". By clicking "Profile" and "Message", page
  will be redirected to matching html. 

By clicking "Active orders", "Finished" or "Posted", you will navigate to "orderpage_buyer.html", and can see the progress of your orders as 
well as your posted request and finished orders. For phase 1, this is still a mock page. Addtionally, we added anchors for all three buttons so
when users click them the page will navigate to the location of "Active orders", "Posted orders" and "Finished orders". The effect can be shown 
when users are using smartphones or device that has narrower width. 

By clicking each product shown on the page, users will navigate to "product_detail_buyer.html", which buyers can then make request on the product they want to purchase. For now, this is still a mock page, and no matter which product user clicks it will show the same "Frozen Vegetables" page since we are not able to work on back end yet.


Clicking "Profile", "Messages" and "Log Out" will link users to "profile_buyer.html", "messages_buyer.html" and "login.html", which will be explained later.

==================
profile_buyer.html
==================

User will be able to edit their profile information in this page such as, email, phone number, active status and other. Under the header, all 
of user's post requests will be shown.
A filter is also included under the header where user can select specific category to the page will display the post that has been posted by user 
under the category selected.


===================
messages_buyer.html
===================

User will be able to see who has sent them messages in the inbox page. By clicking message shown in the inbox page, the page will show the chat
conversation (all the messages sent and received from the target user). In addition to that, once user has entered the chat page, every message
 in the conversation has 2 buttons on the right, the star and delete.  The numbers beside the message is the length of conversation between the
 two users.

When clicking star, the message clicked will be marked as "Starred" and will be shown in there when users click "Starred" on the right side of 
the page. Also, the message is truncated if the length is longer than the width. When the starred message is clicked, it will reveal the full
 message. By clicking "delete", the message will be removed from the chat history.

These functionalities are shown by small number in the menu bar. (# beside inbox displays all messages received so far, # beside sent displays
 all messages sent, # starred displays all messages starred) When deleting a message, it will be shown by the number change in the menu bar in 
the left. By clicking "Sent messages", users will see all messages that they priviously sent to other users. By clicking the message, user will
 also be able to see complete conversation with the target user.

Users can also create "New Message" by clicking the button under the header, for phase 1, this is still a mock function. After filling in the 
new message and clicking send button, the number of sent in the menu bar will increase. If the message is sent to a user that has never 
communicated, the new message is displayed in the sent box. If the message is sent to a user who has communicated before, the number in the
 message with this user will be increased by 1 to indicate the length of conversation. User will have to click on this message to see the full
 conversation and see the new message sent. Reply function sends
new message directly from conversation.
