I created another info section called "trends for you" to show most used hash tags in user account.
This info section is made up with several list-tile sections and each list-tile section is formatted by class".list_tile",
the whole
info section is formatted by id"your_trending_info".
The Section comes several px below section info card, I decided to use position absolute. Since, I found out if I did not use it,
the section would come along after tweets by default and if that could happen, it is not the result I want.
The ul elements in css file is overwritten to get rid of each ul's front bullet.
The "span.hashtag" class  and "span.grey" are shown something we learned from class to enhance any span class with grey
and span specification.
