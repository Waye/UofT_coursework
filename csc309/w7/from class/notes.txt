json
-you cannot add several info into whole json file, you have overwrite whole json file.

-fs.async will catch reading error by it self, not sync fs

create objects from json file
-list
passes a test into filter function(student.year===third year), choose only third year student

-map

-arrow functions
const squareA=(x) => x*x
const squareSix=() => 6*6
(along with filter)

--be careful with arrow function, since arrow function does not bind with 'this'

const s={
    name: 'Jimmy',
    sayName: () => log(this.name)
}

s.sayName();//undefined


-more generic functional array method: reduce()


const totalBalance = accounts.reduce((total,account)=>{
    log(total)// out put
    return total = account.balance
},0)// parameter you add into map or list

log(totalBalance)

'0',start at the end of the first interation

assign to total in next iteration.
0 5 15 12 12

from MDN:
The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each member of the array resulting in a single output value.
const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const reducer = (accumulator, currentValue) => accumulator + currentValue;

// 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
console.log(array1.reduce(reducer));
// expected output: 10

// 5 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
console.log(array1.reduce(reducer, 5));
// expected output: 15
